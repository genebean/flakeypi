# Flakey Pi

_who wouldn't want a flakey pi(e) as a treat?_

This is a simple Nix flake where I am getting a raspberry pi 4 working at a base level before incorporating it into my normal system flake: https://github.com/genebean/dots

Eventually, I plan to make it so I can easily build my own sd card image for a pi from my flake, and all that is easier to test out in this standalone repo.

Some info you see herre is taking from https://github.com/MatthewCroughan/raspberrypi-nixos-example/tree/master but not yet fully implemented.
